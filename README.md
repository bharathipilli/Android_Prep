# What is Android?

Android is an operating system mainly used in:

- Smartphones 📱  
- Tablets  
- Smart TVs  
- Cars (Android Automotive)  
- Embedded devices (POS, kiosks, IoT)  

It is **open-source** and based on the **Linux kernel**.

## In very simple words

👉 **Android = Linux + Google software + Apps**

- **Linux kernel** → talks to hardware  
- **Android system** → manages phone features  
- **Apps** → what users actually use (WhatsApp, Camera, Maps)

## Why Android exists?

Before Android:

- Every phone company had its own OS  
- Apps couldn’t run on different phones  

Android solved this by:

✔ Giving one common OS  
✔ Letting developers write one app that runs on many devices  
✔ Being free and customizable
